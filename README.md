## Features

- Easy Integration: Seamlessly combines the WS2812FX library with an LVGL-based user interface.

- Customization:
- Adjust Mode, Brightness, Speed, and Color directly from the display.
- Save new presets by long pressing any button after configuring your desired settings.
- Hardware Support:
- On the Viewe 4.0 Board, the inbuilt LED is supported.
- Alternatively, connect an external WS2812 LED strip for a larger light show.

## Bugs and Workarounds

1. Brightness Adjustment Bug

- Issue: Adjusting brightness while running reboots the ESP32.
- Cause: A bug with the WS2812FX library and Arduino-ESP32 core v3.
- Workaround: Do not adjust brightness after setup(). Reference: Issue [#356](https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/356)

2. Pixel Shift on Display When Saving Presets

- Issue: Saving preset data to flash causes the display to shift pixels vertically.
- Solution:
- Save presets only by long pressing the WS2812FX logo.
- This will trigger an intentional reboot of the ESP32 to avoid pixel shifting.
